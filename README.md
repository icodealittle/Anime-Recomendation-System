# Anime Recommendation System

## Part 1: Data and Data Pre-processing

- The data used in this experiment was collected from a Kaggle dataset of all the anime on MAL, which
was scraped from MAL public API. The original dataset includes MAL user information such as what
anime they have marked as watched, completed, currently watching, or dropped. It also includes
information on user ratings that score from 1 to 10. There is a separate dataset from the same Kaggle
repository that has general information about all the anime on MAL such as the title of the anime and
genre. This dataset was combined with the user dataset in numerous ways for each of the different data
mining techniques. This data was then preprocessed and cleaned for the various algorithms and matrices
transformations.
